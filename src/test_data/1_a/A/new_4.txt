Is Performing a Cover Version of a Song Copyright Violation?

Simply put, chances are yes. Of course it’s a lot more complicated than that in the long run, but realize that by its very nature a cover is your artistic interpretation of somebody else’s work. Some ways to avoid a copyright violation here include:

    Create a cover that is transformative. That is to say, you’ve put such an original, creative spin on the piece of work that it is unrecognizable as the original.
    Use the YouTube search feature before you cover a song to check the music rights associated with it. Doing the research will save you real problems later.
    Use royalty free tracks that are licensed to you
    Explore the options available to you via YouTube’s own Audio Library.
